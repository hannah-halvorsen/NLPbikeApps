I demonstrated a pipeline from raw app reviews to meaningful categories and then trained
a model to classify new reviews into these categories. Although performance is modest,
this approach provides a framework for ongoing improvements. With enhanced methods
and more data, such a system could guide e-bike companies in prioritizing feature
improvements and addressing user concerns.
